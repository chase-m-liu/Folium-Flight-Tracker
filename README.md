# How to use

1. Sign up with airlabs.co and get a flight data key
2. Change the variable "url" with your flight key
3. Input center_lat and center_lon with your desired mid-point
4. Once you run the program you will be asked for the number of flights to search and the search radius (If it gives you an error it means the program couldn't find anything with your requirements. Just run the program again and put different ones!)
